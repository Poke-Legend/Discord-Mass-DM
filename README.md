### Using MessageEmbed and EmbedBuilder in discord.js

When working with discord.js for bot development, it's important to use the correct classes for creating and managing embeds based on the version of the library you are using.

- **discord.js v13 and Below**: In these versions, you use the `MessageEmbed` class to create embeds. This class allows you to set various properties such as title, description, color, and more to format your message content attractively.
  
### Handling Mass DM Features

Implementing a feature that sends mass direct messages (DMs) can be tricky due to the potential for abuse and the negative impact on user experience. Here are some considerations:

- **Compliance with Discord's Terms of Service**: Always ensure that your bot's features comply with Discord's guidelines. Sending unsolicited mass DMs can be considered spam and might lead to your bot being banned or blocked.
  
- **User Permissions**: It's crucial to have explicit permission from users before sending them direct messages. This can be managed through user settings or commands that allow users to opt-in or opt-out of receiving DMs from your bot.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that your bot provides valuable and engaging interactions while respecting the rules and preferences of the Discord community and its users.
